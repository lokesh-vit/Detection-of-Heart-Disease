# HEART DISEASE PREDICTION SYSTEM USING DATA MINING TECHNIQUES

<br>

**Tool Used:** Rstudio

<p align="justify">In this project, we will find that which algorithm gives more accuracy and further we are going to implement techniques such as <b>Decision Tree, Extreme Boost, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Linear Model and Neural Network</b> in order to get high accuracy. From these techniques, identify the Leaf node and filter computation is done from decision tree obtained.</p>

## Result:
<p align="justify"> The result of the existing system gives 94.4 percent accuracy. From the proposed system, we did leaf node manipulation in the dataset so that error will be reduced by 1% and it has achieved the <b>95.4% accuracy and performance.</b></p>
