# Detection-of-Heart-Disease

**Tool Used:** Rstudio

In this project, we will find that which algorithm gives more accuracy and further we are going to implement techniques such as **Decision Tree, Extreme Boost, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Linear Model and Neural Network** in order to get high accuracy. From these techniques, identify the Leaf node and filter computation is done from decision tree obtained.
