# Detection-of-Heart-Disease

Tool Used: Rstudio

In this project, we will find that which algorithm gives more accuracy and further we are going to implement techniques such as Decision tree, Extreme boost, Random forest, Support vector machine, Linear model and Neural network in order to get high accuracy. From these techniques, identify the Leaf node and filter computation is done from decision tree is obtained.
